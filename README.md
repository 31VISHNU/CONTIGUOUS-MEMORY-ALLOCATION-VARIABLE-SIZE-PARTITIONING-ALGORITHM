# CONTIGUOUS-MEMORY-ALLOCATION-VARIABLE-SIZE-PARTITIONING-ALGORITHM
A python GUI implementation of three memory allocation algorithms (Best Fit, Worst Fit, and First Fit) using the tkinter library. The program defines functions for each allocation algorithm, and upon user interaction with buttons, it opens a window allowing the user to select a partitioning algorithm (Best Fit, Worst Fit, or First Fit). After selecting an algorithm, the program displays the allocated block numbers for each process in a new window using tkinter's Text widget. The initial memory block sizes and process sizes are hardcoded within the code.
